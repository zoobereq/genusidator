### A learning aid to explain grammatical gender assignment in German nouns

### Rationale
One of the biggest challenges for learners of German is accurately identifying the grammatical gender of German nouns (masculine, feminine, or neuter). Unlike native German speakers who learned the grammatical gender mappings via the process of language acquisition, learners of German as a foreign language are not naturally exposed to the gender of German nouns during the formative period of language development. Moreover, the topic is generally not taught in German schools. As a result, even native German speakers tasked with teaching German to foreigners are rarely able to teach their students how to match nouns to their gender. 

This program aims to address the above limitation by automatically generating the rationale behind the gender assignment. In order to accomplish this task, the system relies on a combination of semantic taxonomic relationships and word morphology. The project thus aims to help the learners of German by explaining gender assignment, as opposed to having students resort to traditional rote memorization. One hopes that by understanding these rules, learners will be able to more confidently use entire categories of nouns with the correct gender.
